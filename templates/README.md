#TEMPLATES
----------

In order to override Drupal 8 templates, you should copy them from the classy
core theme (/core/themes/classy/templates) folder to your theme's templates folder.

When adding a new template file to your sub-theme, you will need to rebuild the
"theme registry" in order for Drupal to see it. For more info, see:
